# VisualStructure
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.
I built this application because I wanted to improve my knowledge about these most commonly used Data structures and algorithms to become
a better engineer and software developer.Since I try to visualize them,It's a great oppurtunity for me to code every single algorithms
and understand deeply how they work and how i can manipulate them in order to visualize properly.


## Live server

# Explanation
This website allows you to explore how data structures built and how you can implement certain,most popular algorithms on them.

For now you can use these following properties,
for Data Structures-> Arrays
for Sorting Algorithms-> Bubble Sort,Insertion Sort,Selection Sort

There wil be much more :)
